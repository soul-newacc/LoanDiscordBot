#LoanDiscordBot
My first discord bot done in python

This is just a joke we made along with my friends while playing the economy of the bot "UnbeliavleBoat" or whatever it is called

We had a rule: they had to be stored on jsons! So i learned a little of how to code discord bots and how to do stuff with jsons with python

Im starting to think on creating a full bot with diversity of commands and stuff, for practice i will keep updating this with i learn on the way

# Usage

Its mainly in Spanish so I will translate and explain the commands the most simple I can

/crearprestamos: creates a json file to store info of a loan. Usage: /createloans name [nameOfTheClient] id[IdOfTheClient] amount[AmountOfMoneyLent]

/deleteloan: removes loan files. Usage: /deleteloanloan[NameOfTheFile]

/verprestamos: see loans stored. Usage: /seeloans

/infoprestamo: See information about a loan. Usage: /infoprestamo prestamo[NameOfTheFile]

Yes
