#LoanDiscordBot
My first discord bot done in python

This is just a joke we made along with my friends while playing the economy of the bot "UnbeliavleBoat" or whatever it is called

We had a rule: they had to be stored on jsons! So i learned a little of how to code discord bots and how to do stuff on jsons with python

# Usage

Its mainly in spanish so i will translate and explain the commands the most simple i can

/crearprestamos: creates a json file to store info of a loan. Usage: /crearprestamos nombre [nameOfTheClient] id[IdOfTheClient] monto[AmountOfMoneyLent]

/borrarprestamo: removes loan files. Usage: /borrarprestamo prestamoo[NameOfTheFile]

/verprestamos: see loans stored. Usage: /verprestamos

/infoprestamo: see info of a loan. Usage: /infoprestamo prestamo[NameOfTheFile]
